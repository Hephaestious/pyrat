# pyrat
Simple Python rat with express server for C&amp;C. 

This is only a proof of concept I wanted to make once I found out Python has a command to execute strings on the shell cross-platform. I believe the dependency is 3rd party but you can easily package python scripts and dependencies into executable files. This is not meant to be used for actual attacks, hence the complete lack of obfuscation.
